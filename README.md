## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
1-
you can use Github to fork and clone the repository https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm.
Either way, you will end up with a new directory containing the VM files. Change to this directory in your terminal with cd. Inside, you will find another directory called vagrant. Change directory to the vagrant directory:
              marwa@DESKTOP-640PB0R MINGW64 ~ (master)
              $ cd Downloads
              marwa@DESKTOP-640PB0R MINGW64 ~/Downloads (master)
              $ cd fullstack-nanodegree-vm-master
              marwa@DESKTOP-640PB0R MINGW64 ~/Downloads/fullstack-nanodegree-vm-master (master)
              $ cd fullstack-nanodegree-vm-master
              marwa@DESKTOP-640PB0R MINGW64 ~/Downloads/fullstack-nanodegree-vm-master/fullstack-nanodegree-vm-master (master)
              $ ls
              CODEOWNERS  README.md  vagrant/
              marwa@DESKTOP-640PB0R MINGW64 ~/Downloads/fullstack-nanodegree-vm-master/fullstack-nanodegree-vm-master (master)
              $ cd vagrant
              marwa@DESKTOP-640PB0R MINGW64 ~/Downloads/fullstack-nanodegree-vm-master/fullstack-nanodegree-vm-master/vagrant (master)
              $ ls
              catalog/  forum/  tournament/  Vagrantfile
              marwa@DESKTOP-640PB0R MINGW64 ~/Downloads/fullstack-nanodegree-vm-master/fullstack-nanodegree-vm-master/vagrant (master)
              $ vagrant up
2-
Download folder project from  https://github.com/mareleceng/newspaper-tool and then you will need to unzip this file after downloading it. The file inside is called newsdata.sql. Put this file into the vagrant directory, which is shared with your virtual machine.To build the reporting tool, you'll need to load the site's data into your local database. To load the data, cd into the vagrant directory and use the command cd into folder of project then run psql -d news -f newsdata.sql.
Here's what this command does:
psql — the PostgreSQL command line program
-d news — connect to the database named news which has been set up for you
-f newsdata.sql — run the SQL statements in the file newsdata.sql
Running this command will connect to your installed database server and execute the SQL commands in the downloaded file, creating tables and populating them with data.   

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

1- VirtualBox is the software that actually runs the virtual machine. You can download it from virtualbox.org, here. Install the platform package for your operating system. You do not need the extension pack or the SDK. You do not need to launch VirtualBox after installing it; Vagrant will do that.

2-Vagrant is the software that configures the VM and lets you share files between your host computer and the VM's filesystem. Download it from vagrantup.com. Install the version for your operating system.
Windows users: The Installer may ask you to grant network permissions to Vagrant or make a firewall exception. Be sure to allow this.
